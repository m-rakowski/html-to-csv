html-to-csv
=========

A very simple app that let's you extract metadata from multiple websites and aggregate them into a csv file.

Python libraries used:
* beautifulsoup4
* requests
* flask

The flask part of this app is based on Miguel Grinberg's [microblog application (Flask tutorial.)](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
